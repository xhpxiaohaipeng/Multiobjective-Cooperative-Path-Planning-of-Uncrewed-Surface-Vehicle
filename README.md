# Multiobjective Cooperative Path Planning of Uncrewed Surface Vehicle Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning

This code corresponds to the paper titled "Multiobjective Cooperative Path Planning of Uncrewed Surface Vehicle Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning”:
1.We independently developed a simulation environment for energy-saving path planning of unmanned surface vehicle (USV) ， which supports agent training and can be effectively used for the validation and development of related algorithms. Researchers can directly use this environment, saving significant effort required to build their own, thereby focusing more on the design and improvement of path planning algorithms themselves. If you use this environment in your published research, please cite the aforementioned paper. Proper citation will help gain recognition from the academic community for your work.（H. Xiao, L. Fu, C. Shang, Y. Lin and Y. Fan, "Multiobjective Cooperative Path Planning of Uncrewed Surface Vehicle Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning," in IEEE Internet of Things Journal, vol. 12, no. 8, pp. 9743-9758, 15 April15, 2025, doi: 10.1109/JIOT.2024.3509521.）
2.We proposed a path planning algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning, which enables USV  to achieve navigation planning under energy-saving constraints.
